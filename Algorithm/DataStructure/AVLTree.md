# AVL Tree

## Introduction

AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

## Insert

Let the newly inserted node be w

1. Perform standard BST insert for w.

2. Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path from w to z and x be the grandchild of z that comes on the path from w to z.

3. Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:

    - y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
    - y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
    - y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
    - y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

### Left Left Case

T1, T2, T3 and T4 are subtrees.
         z                                      y
        / \                                   /   \
       y   T4      Right Rotate (z)          x      z
      / \          - - - - - - - - ->      /  \    /  \
     x   T3                               T1  T2  T3  T4
    / \
  T1   T2
```

### Left Right Case

```diagram
     z                               z                           x
    / \                            /   \                        /  \
   y   T4  Left Rotate (y)        x    T4  Right Rotate(z)    y      z
  / \      - - - - - - - - ->    /  \      - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
T1   x                          y    T3                    T1  T2 T3  T4
    / \                        / \
  T2   T3                    T1   T2
```

### Right Right Case

```diagram
  z                                y
 /  \                            /   \
T1   y     Left Rotate(z)       z      x
    /  \   - - - - - - - ->    / \    / \
   T2   x                     T1  T2 T3  T4
       / \
     T3  T4
```

### Right Left Case

```diagram
   z                            z                            x
  / \                          / \                          /  \
T1   y   Right Rotate (y)    T1   x      Left Rotate(z)   z      y
    / \  - - - - - - - - ->     /  \   - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
   x   T4                      T2   y                  T1  T2  T3  T4
  / \                              /  \
T2   T3                           T3   T4
```

## Delete

Let w be the node to be deleted

1. Perform standard BST delete for w.

2. Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the larger height child of z, and x be the larger height child of y. Note that the definitions of x and y are different from insertion here.

3. Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z.The 4 cases is the same as insertion.
