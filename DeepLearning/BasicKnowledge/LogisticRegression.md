# Logistic Regression

## Introduction

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic regression model can also seem as simple neural network. It is a learning algorithm that we use when the output labels Y in a supervised learning problem are all either zero or one, so for binary classification problems.
